# backslash-powered-scanner
This extension complements Burp's active scanner by using a novel approach capable of finding and confirming both known and unknown classes of server-side injection vulnerabilities. Evolved from classic manual techniques, this approach reaps many of the benefits of manual testing including casual WAF evasion, a tiny network footprint, and flexibility in the face of input filtering.

For more information, please refer to the whitepaper at http://blog.portswigger.net/2016/11/backslash-powered-scanning-hunting.html
