<p>This extension complements Burp's active scanner by using a novel approach capable of finding
and confirming both known and unknown classes of server-side injection vulnerabilities.
Evolved from classic manual techniques, this approach reaps many of the benefits of manual testing
including casual WAF evasion, a tiny network footprint, and flexibility in the face of input filtering.</p>
